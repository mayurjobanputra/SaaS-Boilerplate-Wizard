**🌐 Live Demo:** [https://project-saas-boilerplate-wizard-859.magicpatterns.app](https://project-saas-boilerplate-wizard-859.magicpatterns.app)
> **Note:** This is a concept demonstration and UI/UX showcase. The wizard interface is fully functional for exploring configuration options, but it does not actually generate or download boilerplate code. This project demonstrates the user experience and workflow for a SaaS boilerplate generator.
## Overview
SAAS Machine is an interactive wizard that demonstrates how users could generate a custom SaaS boilerplate tailored to their specific requirements. Instead of downloading a massive boilerplate with features you'll never use, SAAS Machine shows how users could pick exactly what they need through an intuitive step-by-step interface.
